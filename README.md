## Introduction
Urbanization has led to a significant reduction in green spaces, impacting air quality, biodiversity, and the overall well-being of city dwellers. The **Urban Green Space Optimizer** is a tool designed to analyze urban data and suggest optimal locations for new parks and green spaces. By leveraging geospatial data and population density metrics, this project aims to promote sustainability and improve urban living conditions.

---

## Problem Statement
- Rapid urbanization has resulted in the loss of green spaces, leading to environmental issues such as poor air quality, urban heat islands, and reduced biodiversity.
- There is a lack of data-driven tools to help urban planners identify optimal locations for new green spaces.

---

## Objectives
- To analyze urban data (population density, environmental factors, and existing green spaces).
- To identify areas with high population density and low green space coverage.
- To suggest optimal locations for new parks and green spaces.
- To create a user-friendly web application for visualizing results.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gather datasets such as population density, air quality, temperature, and existing green spaces.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and merge datasets using Pandas and GeoPandas.
3. **Data Analysis**: Calculate green space per capita and identify areas with low green space coverage.
4. **Visualization**: Use Folium to create interactive maps for optimal locations.
5. **Web Application**: Develop a Flask-based web app to display results.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Web Framework**: Flask
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, GeoPandas
- **Geospatial Visualization**: Folium
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code
